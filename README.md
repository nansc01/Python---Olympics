Step 1:​ Modify the data-set by changing NA values in Medal column to string None -- which will mean no medals. (hint: you may use fillna() method). Output how many records in the dataset has a medal associated with it.​ (30 points) 

Step 2:​ Report the top 3 sports in olympics that has the tallest (on average) athletes. Do the same for shortest, heaviest and lightest athletes. ​(40 points) 

Step 3:​ For winter olympics only, report the team with most Gold medals year by year.​ (40 points) 

Step 4:​ For each sport, report which team dominates it -- team with most medals. ​(40 points) 

Step 5:​ For summer olympics only, create a graph displaying the participation of female athletes to olympics year by year. X axis of the graph is year, and the y axis represent the ratio of female athletes to all athletes participated in that year. ​(30 points)

Step 6: ​Create a graph displaying average athlete age year by year. ​(30 points) 

Step 7:​ We are a small country looking to start participating in Olympics. Based on the data of 2016 olympics only, recommend top 3 sports that is least competitive so we can focus on those. A sport is more competitive if the ratio of athletes participated in that sport is much larger than those that got medals. ​(10 points)
